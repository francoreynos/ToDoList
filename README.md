# ToDoList
This project is a challenge that was brought to me by SanityCare in order to test me to see if I'm qualified to be hired for the job.

## Objectives
The goal for this small project was to create a To-Do list application, where you could create,
read, modify and delete information, in this case some task that are placed inside of a list.

### Things implemented in the assignment
* Language : PHP.
* Framework: No.
* Version Control: Git.
* IDE: PHPStorm.
* Database: MySQL.
* Template: Bootstrap.
* Web Template System: Moustache.
* Web Server used: Apache.

#### Things I would’ve done to make this more efficient
* I would’ve make the input for the new task a little more elegant, or fitting with the
template.
* Even if the input type date has the attribute required it still submits the forum, I
would’ve work around that.
* In the Mobile resolution it has a problem showing the options from the left when you
click the drop down button.
* If you put a later date first and an earlier date second it does not show anything in the
list, it’s a bug a could fix.
* You have to check each task at a time, and it refreshes the page. That could be fixed
using ajax but I run out of time.
